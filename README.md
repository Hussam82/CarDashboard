# ADAS (Advanced Driving Assistance System)

ADAS is a software system designed to assist drivers in driving a vehicle safely and efficiently. This system uses various sensors, cameras, and algorithms to monitor the road and the surroundings of the vehicle, providing real-time feedback to the driver.

## Features

ADAS includes the following features:

- Lane Detection: Alerts the driver when the vehicle is drifting out of its lane.
- Traffic Sign Recognition: Identifies and displays speed limit signs and other traffic signals.
- Pedestrian Detection: Detects pedestrians in the path of the vehicle and alerts the driver.
- Traffic Light Detection: Identifies the traffic lights RED or GREEN.
- Vehicle Detection: Detects vehicles in the road.


## Installation

ADAS is a software system that is typically installed in the vehicle's computer system. The installation process may vary depending on the make and model of the vehicle. It is recommended that the installation is done by a certified professional to ensure proper installation and functionality.
You will have to install Qt Creator of Qt5 version of 5.15.2.
1. Clone the Repo
2. Use the terminal and run the following commands:

mkdir build

qmake ..

make

./CarDashboard

Or use Qt Creator and import the .pro file which imports the whole project, then you can build and run the application.


## Usage

ADAS is designed to assist drivers in driving safely and efficiently. The system provides real-time feedback to the driver, helping them avoid accidents and stay within the speed limit. To use ADAS, the driver must activate the system and follow the instructions provided.

## Limitations

ADAS is designed to assist drivers, but it is not a substitute for safe driving practices. The system may not detect all hazards on the road, and the driver must remain alert at all times. It is also important to note that the system may not function properly in extreme weather conditions or poor visibility.
